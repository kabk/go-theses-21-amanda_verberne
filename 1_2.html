<div class="intro">
Many rituals that we follow nowadays have nothing to do with Christianity. 
Celebrating birthdays, even that of Jesus himself, was uncommon among 
early Christians. What eventually 
became Christmas, the Roman festival Saturnalia, was originally celebrated around the winter solstice. 

</div>
<div class="plat">
		Major events in nature, such as a birth or a solstice, were thought to bring out spirits - and it was critical to keep evil spirits at a distance. Many pagans lit candles to deter bad spirits and protect themselves from the darkness. Due to superstitions about evil spirits attacking unaware children on their birthdays, Germanic groups placed candles on a cake: one candle for each year since birth, and an additional one for another healthy year of life. 
<br><br>
	Just like days of the week, the months of the year draw their names from pagan influences. They refer to festivals, specific gods and goddesses, and work duties tied to specific times of year. June, named for the goddess Juno, reflects the deity’s connection to the sky, marriage, and birth. With the summer solstice, prolific marriages, and general blooming taking place during that time of year, 
the name fits.

Other months with clear pagan origins include April, a name that comes from the pagan festival of Eoster monath. German tribes sacrificed offerings to its namesake, Eoestre - hence, Easter. January is derived from “Giuli,” or yuletide, a word used to describe the time of the year we associate with December and January.
<br><br>
Wearing rings wasn’t a practice exclusive to pagan groups, but wearing a wedding band on the fourth finger of one’s hand may be something Christians adopted from pagan practice. According to religious scholar Samuele Bacchiocchi,10 “the meaning of the wedding ring as a symbol of marital commitment finds its origins not in Scripture, but in pagan mythology and superstitions.”<br>
	This may pair with a Roman and Greek belief that the fourth finger (or third, if you don’t count the thumb) was the so-called “medicated finger,” a digit that had a vein leading directly to the heart. Putting a ring on that finger became a demonstration of unending commitment and love. Still another theory is that wedding rings trace back to the Third Dynasty of the Old Kingdom in Egypt, when rings were exchanged to indicate a binding agreement between two parties.
<br><br>
	If most Christian rituals are from pagan origin then i wonder why Christians keep doing these rituals. Is there is an innate need for people to perform ritual? Humans are rather ritualistic or rather habitual beings, we get up every morning around the time of the sun because people tend to sleep better in alignment with the circadian rhythms, we eat, we go somewhere, we work, we have lunch, work some more, go home, eat, play with the kids, we do some activity for ourselves and go sleep, there is a certain coffee mock we’d like to use, a certain tune we like to listen to get in the mood, a certain suit we wear to do our jobs, when you really think about it there is not much difference between a policeman, Santa Klaus and a man in Africa dressed in a grass suit jumping around symbolizing a spirit from the other world punishing people for their bad deeds. Still in western civilization we seem to have forgotten about the spiritual, the zero point field, god or spirits of 
other worlds.
<br><br>
	A ritual however is not a similar to ordinary gestures of life. It formalizes them until they become “different”. Ritual eating, walking and dancing is not the same as regular eating, walking or dancing. It uses the ordinary and imposes new meaning on to it. 12The rite gets its strength in meaning precisely from that fact that it is free of ambiguity in even the simplest deed. It presents the ideal deed. A rite however is different from a ritual. The rite would be the when and the why, as in a rite of passage happening at a certain milestone for a certain reason. The ritual would be the what and the how11, as in the specific actions taken and the procedures involved. The birth of Christ itself was not an earthshaking event on its own, it deprives its meaning from the rite. 
<br><br>
''It is through initiation that, in primitive and 
archaic societies, man becomes what he is 
and what he should be-a being open to the life of 
the spirit, hence one who participates in the 
culture into which he was born.''11

<br><br>
	The rituals are often pagan in origin so there is no real foundation that would make sense. Maybe this is why Jesus said that the bread available on the table is his body and the accompanying wine is his blood to invent a ritual to anchor a scene to remember him and his teachings by. But if this is true then we could invent any ritual to occupy the sacral space within ourselves and our exterior. 
<br><br>
Jesus tried to teach that you don’t get angry and reactive to adversity and turn the other cheek, did he mean the same as the Buddha meant with letting go of the ego by non reactiveness? And if so then why did the church focus its rituals on a reenactment of a story rather then the experience itself? What if you don’t anchor a story or illustration of the experience but the experience itself? So instead of remembering a story for the sake of it’s values within a ritual or rite as with Christianity, what if we experience what the story is about ourselves by the ritual or rite.
<br><br>
	In the Pentecost island of the South Pacific there is a tribe that performs a ritual called “land diving”12 designed to secure the gods’ favor. It is the ancient precursor of bungee jumping, but here it is considered a sacrifice for the survival of the community and involves a very high jump from a wooden tower, with vines attached to their feet.13 This ritual predates Christianity and falls under the realm of animism which involves sacrifice but as we can see here, there is no actual life being sacrificed but rather a inner space of the ego which is why i think that Marina Abramovic’s “spirit cooking” and other references to human sacrifice is a misguided attempt of reinstituting a lost spiritual practice. On the other side of the coin, there are many examples of a ritual being commercialized without the initial meaning of the ritual, if you bungee jump now, you will undoubtedly do it for the sake of kicks and not consider the initial idea of confronting your own death as a means to strip yourself of your ego, just as much as you would not be thinking of Sufi dancers when you are spinning around on the fun fair.
	<br><br>
	There are certain themes that seem to come back in rituals of, for instance, Australian aboriginals. Themes like the separation of mother, becoming a man, confronting death and dancing as an act of channeling a spirit.11 These rituals bear significant meaning - for example in the ritual of maternal separation, where the boys are taken from their mothers in an abrupt way and the moth- ers believe their sons are taken by a divine entity and killed but resurrected as men. It shows a clear break from boyhood to manhood, something we in today’s society don’t seem to have any more; we stay with our mothers until we marry and then our partner becomes our new mother or we decide it for ourselves around the age of 21 because we ourselves have an understanding what might happen if we do not, there is no physical ritual anymore other then the law telling you that you are an adult when you turn 18 even though these processes are part of growing up.
<br><br>
	In several Australian tribes the men initiate the boys to take them from boyhood to adulthood with a ritual where they dress up with masks acting as divine beings. In the ritual the boys are taken from their mothers. The break is made in such a way as to produce a strong impression both on the mothers and the novices. The Wiradjuri call the initiation ceremonies Guringal, “belonging to the bush.” 
<br><br>
The scenario is the same: according to Howitt,14 the women are covered with branches and blankets; the novices are seized by their guardians and carried off to the forest, where they are daubed with red ocher. Among the Murring, the separation is more abrupt and dramatic. Covered with blankets, the women sit down on the ground with their boys in front of them. At a particular moment the novices are seized by the men, who come up running, and they run away together.12 The novices are violently flung into an unknown world, where the presence of Divine Beings is sensed through the terror that they inspire. The maternal universe was that of the 
profane world. 
<br><br>
	The universe that the novices now enter is that of the sacred world. Between the two, there is a break, a rupture of continuity. Passing from the profane to the sacred world in some sort implies the experience of death; he who makes the passage dies to one life in order to gain access to another. Since the initiation ceremonies were founded by the divine beings or the mythical Ancestors, the primordial Time is reintegrated whenever they are performed. This is true not only for the Australians, but for the entire primitive world. Ritual is not only used to signify a change in someones life but also to make contact with spir- it realms. Most animistic cultures have a notion of spirits, christianity talks about hell and demons and even science justifies that there are at least 11 dimensions.15
<br><br>
	What these rituals focus on is an emotional shift, an abrupt physical experience. Christianity focusses on loving God and yourself but does not include rituals like the ones mentioned above which i believe is doing mankind a great disservice. We can establish that there is a field of sorts that we can communicate with by means of ritual and that established religion and capitalism has not really helped that much with making this communication easier because of focussing on the story rather then the experience itself where pagan practices (under which animism is subcategorized) actually do maintain an interactive method because of a more extended range of bodily sensation and experience.
