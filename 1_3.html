<div class="intro">
Wim Hof “The Iceman” is capable of 
influencing his autonomic nervous 
system. He achieved this by regularly going in to ice water and control his breathing. He is basically meditating under very harsh conditions. What happens normally when you suddenly or even gradually go in ice water is that your breathing 
becomes choppy and erratic. 
</div>
<div class="plat">
&emsp; This is also the reason why in the 1600’s many people died when they fell in the water when attempting to clean cloths or dishes. The cold makes you gasp for air and because of the water absorbent wool clothing they couldn’t get up easily either so they would drown.Wim Hof however trained himself to be able to not gasp for air and to even regulate his body temperature through meditative practices. A study has been done to the effects of the Wim Hof method12 and has been published in PNAS and Nature. You basically take an ice cold shower and make sure you take deep breaths in instead of choppy breathing. 
<br><br>
The idea behind the breathing is to do 30-40 reps of inhaling fully and exhaling partially. It is said that this method improves the immune system and many people report having less headaches, getting less sick, their tolerance for pain increased, they had more focus and felt overal calmer, more motivated and a sharper mind. Taking cold showers has been known for a long time to improve the immune system, the Wim Hof method takes it a step further by jumping in to actual 
ice water. 
<br><br>
I think the idea is to widen your range of sensory stimuli overload pointers, to stretch your ability to handle pain or discomfort and face your fears and comforts to therefor be a stronger person in the end. Facing your fears is long known to make you a stronger person and there is discomfort in the process of doing so.
The concept of getting enlightened by pain is not new. Self-flagellation<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote"></a></sup> is the disciplinary and devotional practice of flogging oneself with whips or other instruments that inflict pain.In Catholicism, self-flagellation is practiced in the context of the doctrine of the mortification of the flesh and is seen as a spiritual discipline. It is often used as a form of penance and is intended to allow the flagellant to share in the sufferings of Jesus, bringing his or her focus to God. 
<br><br>
These practices bare similarity with the Buddha’s original teachings of enlightenment (modern day Vipassana meditation retreats). The method at the retreat is consistent of 3 days sharpening the minds focus by focusing on the sensations of you upper lip, only sensations, no visualizations or anything else. Then you move to your skin and go from the top of the head over your whole body, as according to one of the teachers present there to “open the body” and then after another 4-5 days you move to inside of the body and go from sensation to sensation while you remain silently seated and don’t react in any way. 
<br><br>
The idea is that all emotions are stored in the body as sensations, because we don’t react to a mental idea of what is happening to us but to the sensation that we feel in our body as emotion. The word emotion is itself is consistent of 
e=energy in motion. Vipassana meditation focusses on feeling these energy’s as sensations and not reacting on them because according to the buddha reacting on them creates new Sancara. Sancara is said to be emotions that are reincarnated from past lives, a sort of blueprint and whatever you do in this life will be transferred in to the next if you don’t “solve” these emotions by feeling them. 
<br><br>
I myself went to a 10-day retreat and noticed great changes in my being, i dissolved many of my childhood trauma’s and on one particular day i experienced that my view changed from 3D to 5D in terms of unconditional love and understanding, it was like i suddenly had a bird’s eye view of all the relationships i had and could see and understand each individuals suffering, i felt like i transcended all of my own suffering in regards to these people and felt nothing but unconditional 
love for each living thing. Sadly this experience did not last very long and when i talked to one of the teachers she told me to not attach to this experience because my attachment to the experience will hinder me from letting go of attachment which was the point to begin with.
Many of the sensations can be experienced as deeply unpleasant, you have an itch you can not scratch, you have anger you can not smoke away or sadness you can not cry. For this reason i think that the Wim Hof method is so affective because it forces you to go through the uncomfortableness while not reacting on it. In Christian beliefs the focus was mainly the idea to get closer to god by joining in with the suffering of Christ, i would like to argue that the focus of the experience is put in the wrong place and the initial practice was meant to release attachment of your sins rather then joining in the pain of Christ. The problem with this practice is that internally you can still attach to the sin you have done and the practice is focussed on punishment rather than enlightenment. 
<br><br>
You can find similar practices for instance in islam religion on the Muharram festival or in Judaism. While Wim Hof makes a conscious effort to not react and to breath through the process. These are two different approaches, one is to expand your capability of pain and the other is to clean up the 
inner space.
