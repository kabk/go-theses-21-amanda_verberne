“Kepler supposes that the secret of the marvelous correspondence is to be found in the earth, because the earth is animated by an anima telluris, for whose existence he adduces a number of proofs. Among these are: the constant temperature below the surface of the earth; the peculiar power of the earth-soul to produce metals, minerals, and fossils, namely the facultas formatrix, which is similar to that of the womb and can bring forth in the bowels of the earth shapes that are otherwise found only outside — ships, fishes, kings, popes, monks, soldiers, etc.; further the practice of geometry, for it produces the five geometrical bodies and the six-cornered figures in crystals. The anima telluris has all this from an original impulse, independent of the reflection and ratiocination of man. The seat of astrological synchronicity is not in the planets but in the earth ; not in matter, but in the Anima Telluris”18

As M. J. Barrett mentions in his paper Enabling hybrid space: epistemological diversity in socio-ecological problem-solving that there is increasing recognition that modern Western scientific approaches, although important, are not enough to resolve complex environmental problems because of a reductionist approach to understanding ecological systems, placing the human above and separate from natural systems, and the emphasis on a physical material reality as primary, and perhaps the only reality that exists. I would like to argue that in terms of spirituality and this applies aswell.
<br><br>
The reductionist approach19 is exactly how we lost spirituality in western society; in my previous work I was researching the relationship between chaos and order and learned how the butterfly effect impacts stock markets19 From this research became clear that “chaos” is in fact not quantifiable and that we live in a much more mysterious world then popular 
belief dictates.

Both Nietzsche and Stirner saw in Christianity the leveller of the human race, the breaker of man’s will to dare and to do. They saw in every movement built on Christian morality and ethics attempts not at the emancipation from slavery, but for the perpetuation thereof. Hence they vehe- mently opposed these movements. 
<br><br>
Today if you even mention Christianity in artistic circles 
people will look at you strangely, there will be comments 
about corruption and sexual abuse from priests. Maybe 
science, animism, paganism and Christianity are all talking about the same thing, the chaotic Anima Telluris; the only difference in paganism or animism is that they are active 
participants in making contact with these “other dimensions”.
<br><br>
There is a concept in Quantum Mechanics called Quantum entanglement20 which plainly explained suggests that there are particles that are sets of two opposites and that transcends time and space maybe this is why you feel alive when you are facing death, why somone needs love when they are giving hate and many other counterintuitive concepts in life. Maybe the act of ritual gave way to acces different dimensions of what it means to be alive.
<br><br>
Since the rituals seem to have themes overlapping but not a strict guiding conduct, I would like to argue that we can 
create our own ritual following the themes and initiation 
basics of the intention set within it. This I will investigate 
on an experiential level on myself and share my findings in 
the next chapter.
