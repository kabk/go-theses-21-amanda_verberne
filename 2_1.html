<div class="intro">
I have selected three rituals to perform myself, a burning ceremony, a burial and a baptism. Why I choose these particular rituals is because I wanted to strip myself of layers of ego that can interfere with communication with the Anima Telluris and decided these were the most effective.

<div class="plat">
&emsp; A burning ritual to release myself from my personal past by ritually burning with intent all pictures and objects that held meaning from my childhood, a burial to release my constrictions of generally being a human being, in the sense of having a layer of ego based in primal fear of death and a baptism to initiate myself in a new or rather older form of spirituality combined with Wim Hof’s method. 
A burning ceremony is a transformative ritual traditionally performed as a way of releasing something that no longer serves you. It is often performed on New Year’s Eve or other meaningful holidays or dates. During a burning ceremony, fire is portrayed as a powerful symbol of wisdom, knowledge, passion, and purification.
<br><br>
A burning ritual is a very common ritual people use to get over their ex-boyfriend. There is even an episode in the popular series Friends where the girls burn pictures of their ex boyfriends on Valentine’s Day. The reason why this ritual is effective is because of the intent of letting go of the past and not having the physical objects around anymore to look back at, it is an emotional shift within yourself, a way of releasing the past, negativity, old resentments, hurt, grudges, regrets, or suffering, and focus on what is more significant to us. 
<br><br>
You typically perform a burning ceremony during special symbolic times; I have chosen to burn a selection of objects and photographs representative of what I want to let go of on the day of a new moon. As a new moon represents the start of a new lunar cycle, it symbolizes new beginnings. People use the energy of a new moon to achieve their goals or start on a new project. They also reflect on their old goals and set themselves new ones. The sun represents our ‘outer-world’, our identity, our personality, our ego. It represents how we ‘shine our light’ out into the world, the present moment, our yang or masculine archetype expression.
The moon represents our “inner world”, our emotions, our shadow-self, subconscious, fears and dreams. Our unconscious beliefs, the past and our yin or feminine goddess archetype. It represents the chaos part of chaos and order. The Moon offers us the ability to feel, learn from the past and creatively unlock and express our essence. The New Moon is a great time to set your intentions, write down goals or begin new projects for the forthcoming cycle.
A full moon is very different.
<br><br>
The energy of a Full Moon is heightened and emotions, feelings, mental processes, dreams, etc. are all amplified. Therefore I have chosen to do the burial and bap- tism during a full moon. This is also the reason why during full moon or new moon there are no- ticeable fluctuations on the stock market. Several studies found a connection between full and new Moons and stock market performance. Generally, stocks tend to perform better in the days around the New Moon, while price weakness is more frequently seen in the days around Full Moon.21
<br><br>
I did all the rituals on the beach at Scheveningen during a full moon and the burial during a special full moon because I was searching for a closer relationship to nature. I noticed a calm energy on the burning ritual day, it was dark and quiet. I was sorting through all my memories printed of pieces of paper, connecting my emotional experiences to them and burning them in to the fire. Not because of a failed relationship as was shown in the series Friends but because I wanted to get rid of everything that constituted me as an ego driven human being, to become an empty vessel in service of housing a connection with the Anima Telluris.
