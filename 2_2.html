	“Like the somber cadence of a tolling bell of the funereal drumbeat for a fallen leader, burial most immediately evokes an utmost sense of finality. Although death and life will continuously merge and separate in the grave, burial 
	nevertheless marks the terminus of a particular existence of embodiment. 
	The setting apart and consecration of this vanished life establishes the 
	ultimate boundary between the “quick” and the dead. At the grave the living must irrevocably surrender the last bodily vestiges of the beloved’s once animate, inspirited presence to the silence and mystery to the “underworld.” Bodies (or the ashes or noes of bodies) may be buried in the depths of the sea, in caves or trees, in the walls or floor of a church or even in the belly of the human being or animal that 
	eats them.“21

&emsp;Since the Stone Age, however, burial in the earth (Latin humus or terra) has been a natural and efficient way for numerous cultures to dispose of a dead body. Inhumation, interment, is rendered colloquially as “planting” the dead, with all the implication upon the inevitable decomposition and decay of organic matter. Like a seed flourished and release from its vegetative mother, ready to sprout another form of life in the womb of mother earth.The idea of burial as planting however alludes to the mysteries of descent and resurrection, The image evokes not only ultimate submersion in the body, but also the fertilizing humus of psychic depths and the dissolutions that release rich elements of transformation.22

A spirit animal23 is characterized as a teacher or messenger that comes in the form of an animal and has a personal relationship to an individual. Other names might be animal guides, spirit helpers, spirit allies, power animals, or animal helpers. It is believed that you do not choose the animal, rather it chooses, or has already chosen you. The animal is there to provide “medicine” to the recipient in the form of guidance, lessons, protection, power, or wisdom. Shamans worldwide have relied on the guidance, wisdom, and symbolism of spirit animals for thousands of years.
<br><br>
There were several animals that came to visit me in this process. Normally speaking I don’t get visited by animals at all except a seagull that tries to eat me plants. I remember very clearly that my journey off this thesis started when I was in the forest surrounded by frogs, there was a synchronicity happening, a higher meaning, for the person I was with it bared no significance but for some reason I felt that there was something important about these frogs in relation to me. 
I couldn’t get the frogs out of my head so I searched up their meaning and found that frogs were sacred to Heqet, goddess  of embryonic waters. She was the wife of Khnum, who molded material human life on his potter’s wheel. Heqet helped to fashion their forms inside the womb as midwife and protector of the pregnant and newborn. The richness of the frog’s symbolism is in this linking to womb, waters, fertility and developing life. Highly dependent on water, frogs absorb it from the environment through their permeable skins. Much like birthing a child in the position of a frog we can use the symbolism of a frog as we are wombing in the earth of 
Mother Nature.22 
<br><br>
For me this signaled that is it was the beginning of something new, a process that is about to start where I will be transformed in to something else, to house something else then my regular sense of being. The relation to waters symbolized that it might have something to do with the emotional realm. Waters are long associated with emotions, “deep waters” or the fact that scorpio, cancer and pisces are classified as water elements in horoscopes. In the coming weeks I was helping out on a particular project that dealt with spirituality and nature aswel and I noticed great changes within myself on an emotional level, I was unconsciously waiting for most of my life for a sign, a feeling, a signal that this is where I am supposed to be, it was like listening to other peoples story’s but not experiencing it myself. Except in the Vipassana retreat and working on this project I experienced something happening within myself, emotional shifts, this is how I knew I was on a track that I had to explore further.
After this project I started noticing I am more sensitive to the zero point field, my judgements fell away and things started manifesting on an experiential level, I was visited by more animals and small strange synchronicities12 started to happen. I had strange dreams that later on somehow manifested in my life, for instance I had a dream about my downstairs neighbor opening my front door and leaving the door ajar saying “come on neighbor, this vessel is not funny anymore” and in my dream I was wondering how did he get my keys and the more I opened the door the more my fingers got jammed in the bending handle. 
<br><br>
I generally speaking never see my downstairs neighbor but then 2 days after this dream my neighbor got locked out of his house and we both tried to open the door and I noticed that his hand was behind the handle when he tried to push down the door and it was bending over so I warned him to watch his hands, if he pushed it a few more times like that his fingers would have been cut off since it was one of those doorhandles that are really too poorly designed to be doorhandles. 
<br><br>
A few days later he was assaulted in his house by a blind date that tried to rob and kill him. Luckily for him he was strong enough to hit them in the face and get them out of his house while I was on the phone with the police since me and my roommate both heard something was going on. This situation would have gone very differently if he had a damaged hand. 
<br><br>
My sensitivity was changing in strange ways, I remember talking to my roommate about how she thinks Facebook is listening to her when she is on the phone with her sister because of related adds that started showing up to things she was talking about and then her sister responded jokingly cat-litter! cat-litter! cat-litter! In Bulgarian and there was no way that I could have even heard that or understood it since I don’t know any Bulgarian language and later that evening I was standing in the Albert Heijn staring at cat-litter for at least 10 minutes comparing different brands with each other till I suddenly thought to myself that I don’t have a cat and that I am allergic to cats so there is no reason for me to even look at these products.
<br><br>
I was also visited by a Cyanistes caeruleus or blue tit bird on the night of the burning ritual, this totem bird is associated with the arrival of a brighter future. The Blue Tit is a symbol of love, faith, hope and honor. To see a Blue tit fly in the sky is a sign or omen of love on its way. To sailors, the Blue Tit is a sign of loyalty or luck. It is helps in friendship, honor and family. Since Blue Tits never fly far distances from their homes, the sight of them always denote good tidings to a sailor. It would mean that land is near. Blue Tits are also believed to carry the spirits of sailors who have died at sea, to their home in heaven. The Blue Tit allows one to remember the best things in life. Especially those that we have successfully completed. In Celtic symbolism, the Blue Tit is seen as a powerful symbol. Since I was about to embark on releasing finished identity’s and concepts of the past that I was so loyal to for so long in a burning ritual, this omen was very welcome.
It was 31 Oktober 2020, the night of Samhain. Ancient Celts marked Samhain as the most significant of the four quarterly fire festivals, taking place at the midpoint between the fall equinox and the winter solstice. During this time of year, it is believed that the barrier between worlds was breach-able. It was expected that ancestors might cross over during this time as well, and Celts would dress as animals and monsters so that fairies were not tempted to kidnap them.

This is where Halloween originally came from. Intuitively i decided that on this day is when i should do the burial, it was also a blue moon. Every full moon has a deeply personal significance different for each individual, alongside its more general collective significance. Energy at a full moon is heightened favoring activity and effort, in contrast to the dark of a new moon when energy levels are low and the natural tendency is to retreat into stillness as a new cycle is born. An astrological blue moon is a full moon amplified. Its energy is expressive and dynamic, making it a good time to do what’s needed to bring things to fruition. This particular blue moon, i found out after the ordeal was done, was a good time to reaches your own needs and your needs in relation to others and also to reconstruct old habits and see what needs 
to be let go.
<br><br>
We walked alongside the beach finding a good spot to do the burial, i look up and i see a giant ring appear around the moon as we walk to the spot where we decided to do the initiation ritual, it was so clear and bright, i could feel a very specific energy in the air, we all felt it. We found a spot and i prepare the oil-lamp candles to light the way towards the water, symbolizing to transition from one element to another. 
I put down the blanket i handcrafted myself a few meters away form the grave with an oil-lamp bowl on each side. 
I also placed one large clay handmade bowl with an in oil drenched rope positioned in a circle on fire at the head of the grave. We dug the grave and i took a moment to collect my intentions and took my cloths off and lay in it. I had a hose through which i could breath. The sand was cold and wet. I found a position to lay in and the burial started, the sand was so heavy that it pressed against my chest every time i 
breath in. 
<br><br>
There is something absolutely terrifying about being buried alive, you can’t breath through your nose, its heavy all around you, you cant open your eyes or move around. i tried to remain still as much as i could, it felt like i was confronted with actual death. 

Even though i know mentally that everything is under control and i choose to do this, i orchestrated every move, still my body responded as if i was actually being buried alive, somehow my body remembers the sensations and reacts on them accordingly. I was not sure what to expect from the whole experience, i made my intention to release old layers of myself so i could serve the world in a better way but i did not expect it would happen in such an abrupt brutal way. 
<br><br>
Being confronted with you own death makes you realize all the stupid things you have said and done in the past that you wish you did not have, all the things you still want to do, all the nonsensical insecure things you say to yourself that are keeping you back from living your life the way you want to, all the times you said no to an opportunity when you should have said yes, all the love you still want to give but was not able to because of layers of ego that withheld you from it. I did not expect to be confronted with this. It felt like the sand was penetrating my inner core of emotional realms, to lay still in the cold, to completely accept my faith in the hands of another human being, it is the fear that forces you outside of your body and further in, to find a new core of self-actualization, who you are, who you were and who you are going to be, readjusted, reformed by an experiential force of nature, fear. 
<br><br>
My body was shaking beyond my control from the cold and pressure and my breathing was steady but heavy at all times in the grave. At some point i feel hands taking off the sand, i knew this was my que that i was going to be dug up, a feeling of relieve overwhelmed me. I am dragged on my feet to the blanket, it was even more cold then before, i was shaking even though i tried my best to stay as still as i could. I am wrapped in the blanket and ropes are put around me, preparing me to be dragged to the sea. We practiced how to be wrapped and roped beforehand but i could notice rather immediately that it was not done as we practiced. 
<br><br>
Since a part of the initiation is that i relinquish full control i could not tell him that it was not done correctly. To be in the hands of another human being is a very confronting experience, i realized how much of a control freak i actually am. Then he started to drag me along side the oil-lamps, he was struggling hard with it, it was really hard for me to remain still and not tell him that “here is ok” or “never mind i hear you are struggling”. We all agreed to perform this initiation and discussed every step of the way. 
<br><br>
This made me realize how much i actually put myself aside in situations to make things easier for other people, as if i had no right to be, much more then i previously thought. When left at the seaside on a dark piece of sand, after a while i got up just before the water hit me, it was already quit an experience that i felt i needed some time to integrate it all before baptizing myself. I walked back slowly thinking about what just happened to me, trying to feel what parts are where in my body since it felt like a whirlwind entered my entire being and threw everything on it’s head and some parts were not there anymore, some parts were more prominent, they had 
more space. 
<br><br>
To close off the ritual i poured some of my blood i had collected in a glass jar in to the grave to symbolize that what i have left behind. I took some time in silence and got dressed, we collected the jars and when we sat down i noticed the circle around the moon started to disappear. 

After the whole experience I was visited by a fox. a fox is called “son of the earth” by the incas, the fox’s ability to hear through the earth about far-off events made him a diviner-curer, just as the fox-guide’s subterranean knowledge led North American and Siberian shamans through paths not ordinarily open or visible to humans. Thus if we approach the ubiquitous, mercurial fox–like the unconscious–on its own terms, it may guide us through the transformational spaces between oppositional states of being–between wild forest and cultivated farmland, between unconventional, intuitive intelligence and collective social norms, and between animal, human and spirit worlds, both beneficent and demonic–in the service 
of wholeness.22
