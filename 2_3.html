<div class="intro">
It was a freezing cold night. I went to the beach to baptize myself in freezing cold water in the same way that the Jehova’s Witnesses do it but then without someone doing it to me but me doing it to myself since i am initiating myself in to the Anima Telluris. The way they do it is one hand on the nose and mouth and one on the wrist and then fall backwards in to the water and arise. 
</div>


<div class="plat">
&emsp;I am standing naked in front of the confronting water setting my intention to leave something of myself in the water and regain something else. It was very windy and i have not been looking forward to this. It is the middle of the winter and it is night. There is nobody around, just me and the frightening sea. I was most affraid of drowning. All these thoughts go through my head about the Jehova’s Witneses, how my family got baptized and how they are faring in life now. Growing up in that environment really did a number on my sister and my brother was so affraid of the world that he went back.
<br><br>
Still we all believed so much, indoctrination is a dangerous thing, seeying other people as “wordly”, “tainted”, “lost souls” that need saving, like dirty clothing that needs washing. It is join or leave, maybe that is why i have not seen my brother in years. I am standing in front of the water contemplating where i am now, what i have achieved so far, how much i have learned and grown as a person and i think to myself that i can not be anything else but grateful for my process and all the help i have been given, for the people and tutors that i have met esspecially on art school.
<br><br>
It is because of art school that i am busy with this process, removing layers and layers of previous ego, learning more 
and more about myself and the world. 
This baptism is a celebration of where i am and at the same time a ritual to initiate myself in the knowledge of mother nature, there is so much more then indoctrinative religions teach. I stayed in the water for a bit to try to apply the Wim Hof method. It was so cold that i had to find a place within myself to regain some calmness. Here is where my 10 days of meditation retreat came in handy, try to stay calm, try to focus, let the pain wash over your body, accept it, don’t clinge to it.
<br><br>
The water hurts like hell, it is below zero. The darkness of the night is overwhelming and powerfull yet not intimidating.
Coming out of the water i felt sharper and stronger and in more connection with my surrounding, more present. It is incredibly cold and i am not used to this at all but i am happy i did not drown and that i finished my experiments. My plan is to keep taking cold dips every once in a while to sharpen my mind and hopefully create a practice of it.
