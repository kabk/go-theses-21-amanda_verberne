<div class="intro">
Early in The Ethics Spinoza argues that 
there is only one substance, which is absolutely infinite, self-caused, and eternal. He calls this substance “God”, or “Nature” 
—Deus sive Natura. 
</div>
<div class="plat">
&emsp; The Bible mentions that God reveals himself in nature. To see His creation is to see a piece of Him. As it says in Romans 1:20, “For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.” 
<br><br>
So why do we make such an effort to exclude nature from our lives, in the concrete boxes we call homes, the plastic wrapped goods we call food ? Where did human intervention stop having a sense of the presence of Spinoza’s “substance”, while all that remains is the newtonian tangibility in the materiality of our constructed spaces? What materials can we construct our spaces of? Is there a ritualistic attention we can provide to a space? We are seeing more and more how the alteration of food, for instance, is making us sick - isolated nutrition pills, genetically modified vegetables, added hormones - the list goes on about human interventions on original manifestations. 
<br><br>
I would like to explore on a spiritual level the effects of nature and space on my being. I will undergo a series of ritualistic interventions, in search of a new path, the line between the yin and yang, to explore the space within myself and manifest outside of myself, using the elements of nature to rid myself of layers of societal comfort to find a new truth.
