<div class="intro">
“It is by going down into the abyss that we recover the treasures of life. Where you stumble, there lies your treasure.”
– Joseph Campbell

<div class="plat">
&emsp; Empty streets, void of any human civilization to be heard or seen, only the occasional ambulance. I myself already experienced a great sense of loss in the year that COVID-19 swept away society’s feet, slowing everybody down to the pace of which I could relate, a pace in which I felt comfortable. My experiences made me completely desensitized and disconnected and it is from this ground that I undergo a process of rebirth. If my old path has lead me to end up here than surely a new path is needed, a new foundation, a deeper purpose. Our ephemeral existence in today’s society combined with a new sense of instability has caused me to be in search of a higher meaning.
